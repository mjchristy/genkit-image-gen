Avoid bright, saturated, or clashing colors. High contrast can be achieved with black and white, but always with clean lines.\\n\\n3.  **Clean Lines and Geometric Forms:**\\n    *   Emphasize sleek, clean lines and strong, simple geometric shapes in furniture, architectural elements, and objects.\\n    *   Forms should be functional, elegant, and devoid of excessive ornamentation, intricate patterns, or fussy details.\\n    *   Surfaces should appear smooth, refined, and often planar.\\n\\n4.  **Strategic and Abundant Use of Negative Space:**\\n    *   This is paramount. Ensure generous empty space (negative space) around objects, furniture, and within the overall composition.\\n    *   Negative space is not empty but acts as a design element, creating a sense of openness, drawing attention to the few items present, and contributing significantly to a feeling of calm, clarity, and breathability.\\n\\n5.  **Natural and Diffused Lighting:**\\n    *   Integrate soft, natural, and diffused lighting as the primary light source.\\n    *   Avoid harsh shadows or overly dramatic contrasts.\\n    *   Lighting should subtly highlight textures and forms, contributing to a serene and gentle atmosphere. Think large windows with sheer coverings, concealed LED strips, or simple, sculptural light fixtures that emit a warm, even glow.\\n\\n6.  **Thoughtful Materiality:**\\n    *   Incorporate natural, tactile materials in a refined and understated way. Examples include light-toned wood, polished concrete, linen, wool, ceramic, glass, and brushed metals.\\n    *   Textures should be subtle and inviting, adding depth and warmth without being visually busy or distracting. The beauty of the material itself should be evident.\\n\\n7.  **Curated Object Selection:**\\n    *   Every object included must be carefully chosen for both its essential function and its intrinsic aesthetic appeal.\\n    *   Limit decorative items to a very select few. Examples include a single, sculptural vase, a well-placed plant with clean lines (e.g., a snake plant, fiddle leaf fig), a stack of aesthetically pleasing books, or one piece of abstract, understated art.\\n    *   Avoid collections, busy patterns, excessive decor, or anything that feels superfluous. Each item should be able to \\\"breathe\\\" within its space.\\n\\n**Overall Impression:** The modified image should evoke a profound sense of peace, sophisticated simplicity, spaciousness, and a mindful, deliberate approach to design.
