Think **creams, off-whites, warm beiges, sandy tones, terracotta, muted browns, and warm grays.**\\n    *   **Accents:** Introduce **rich, jewel tones** sparingly or in patterns: deep emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red, amethyst purple, mustard yellow, rust orange, and olive green. Dusty rose and burnt orange are also common.\\n    *   **Avoid:** Harsh brights, stark whites, or a clinical feel.\\n\\n2.  **Materials & Textures (Layering is Key!):**\\n    *   **Natural Fibers:** **Macrame, rattan, wicker, jute, hemp, linen, cotton, wool, sheepskin/faux fur.** These should be *prominent* in furniture, textiles, and decor.\\n    *   **Wood:** **Natural, reclaimed, or slightly distressed wood** (light to medium tones) for furniture, shelves, and accents.\\n    *   **Metals:** **Aged brass, copper, or wrought iron** for light fixtures, decorative objects, or furniture accents.\\n    *   **Ceramics/Pottery:** Handmade, imperfect, often unglazed or with earthy glazes.\\n    *   **Leather:** Distressed leather poufs or cushions can add a touch of warmth.\\n    *   **Glass:** Textured, colored, or vintage glass.\\n\\n3.  **Patterns & Prints:**\\n    *   **Global Inspired:** **Moroccan patterns (geometric, tile-like), Indian block prints (paisley, floral, mandala), Persian or Kilim rug designs, Aztec/Southwestern motifs, and tribal patterns.**\\n    *   **Botanical:** Subtle, stylized floral or leaf patterns.\\n    *   **Mix-and-Match:** The beauty of boho is in **combining different patterns and textures** without them clashing, creating a visually rich tapestry.

Use **terracotta pots, woven baskets, or macrame hangers.**\\n    *   **Lighting:** **Soft, ambient, and layered.** String lights (fairy lights), Moroccan lanterns, woven pendant lights (rattan, macrame), floor lamps with textile shades, candles. Natural light is often maximized.\\n    *   **Art & Wall Decor:** **Eclectic gallery walls** with framed prints (abstract, nature, travel photography), woven baskets, mirrors (rattan-framed, sunburst), macrame wall hangings, dream catchers, ethnic masks, or hand-drawn sketches.\\n    *   **Collected Objects:** Books, unique trinkets, pottery, carved wood figures, beads, shells, or souvenirs from \\\"travels.\\\"\\n    *   **Rugs:** **Layered rugs** are a signature – think jute layered with a patterned Kilim or Persian rug, or a sheepskin rug.\\n\\n6.  **Sensory Elements (Implied):**\\n    *   The image should convey a sense of **calmness, warmth, and a subtle aroma** of incense or natural oils (even if not visible, the mood should suggest it).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In summary, when rendering the \\\"boho\\\" style, think:**\\n\\n*   **Natural & Organic:** Raw materials, plants, earthy tones.\\n*   **Layered & Textured:** A rich interplay of fabrics, weaves, and surfaces.\\n*   **Eclectic & Global:** A mix of patterns, furniture styles, and collected items.\\n*   **Relaxed & Inviting:** Comfortable seating, soft lighting, and an overall welcoming atmosphere.\\n*   **Handmade & Artisanal:** Items that look unique and crafted with care.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**IMPORTANT: For the image generation, please modify the *existing image* to incorporate the boho decor style as described above.** Focus on seamlessly integrating these elements rather than creating an entirely new scene.
