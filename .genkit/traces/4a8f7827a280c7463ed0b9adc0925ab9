Think **creams, off-whites, warm beiges, sandy tones, terracotta, muted browns, and warm grays.**\\n    *   **Accents:** Introduce **rich, jewel tones** sparingly or in patterns: deep emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red, amethyst purple, mustard yellow, rust orange, and olive green. Dusty rose and burnt orange are also common.\\n    *   **Avoid:** Harsh brights, stark whites, or a clinical feel.\\n\\n2.  **Materials & Textures (Layering is Key!):**\\n    *   **Natural Fibers:** **Macrame, rattan, wicker, jute, hemp, linen, cotton, wool, sheepskin/faux fur.** These should be *prominent* in furniture, textiles, and decor.\\n    *   **Wood:** **Natural, reclaimed, or slightly distressed wood** (light to medium tones) for furniture, shelves, and accents.\\n    *   **Metals:** **Aged brass, copper, or wrought iron** for light fixtures, decorative objects, or furniture accents.\\n    *   **Ceramics/Pottery:** Handmade, imperfect, often unglazed or with earthy glazes.\\n    *   **Leather:** Distressed leather poufs or cushions can add a touch of warmth.\\n    *   **Glass:** Textured, colored, or vintage glass.\\n\\n3.  **Patterns & Prints:**\\n    *   **Global Inspired:** **Moroccan patterns (geometric, tile-like), Indian block prints (paisley, floral, mandala), Persian or Kilim rug designs, Aztec/Southwestern motifs, and tribal patterns.**\\n    *   **Botanical:** Subtle, stylized floral or leaf patterns.\\n    *   **Mix-and-Match:** The beauty of boho is in **combining different patterns and textures** without them clashing, creating a visually rich tapestry.
