They viewed the U.S. as an intrusive force in Muslim lands.\\\\nDesire to Martyr Themselves in the Name of Religion: The hijackers were driven by a warped interpretation of Islam that promised rewards for martyrdom. They believed they were carrying out acts of religious duty.\\\\nInflicting Maximum Damage and Instilling Fear: The attacks were designed to cause immense economic and psychological damage to the United States. Al-Qaeda aimed to cripple America's sense of security and power.\\\\nImportant Considerations:\\\\n\\\\nWhile religious extremism played a role, it's crucial to recognize that al-Qaeda's motivations were also political.
